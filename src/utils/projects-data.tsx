In this case, I focused on making sure that the filter for the products in the 'supposed store' worked correctly, regardless of how they were searched. In addition to this, I added a message to inform the user in case there were no products in the range searched.",

This project does not stop at the simple; it has reached more ambitious goals. First, a system of protected routes has been implemented, reserved exclusively for users who have registered previously. The registration process grants users a JWT (JSON Web Token) with a duration of one hour, ensuring the security of the platform. In addition, the image upload function directly to Cloudinary from the backend has been enabled, providing an even more complete and efficient experience.",
